          <h2>Victoria Falls</h2>
		  <p>The Victoria Falls is the greatest curtain of falling water in the world. They are located in the boarder of Zambia and Zimbabwe, in Southern Africa, as part of the Zambezi River. They were named by the Scottish explorer Dr. David Livingstone, after the British queen of that time, but they are also called Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means “smoke that thunders”. These splendorous falls are twice the height of the well-known Niagara Falls, in North America, and over twice the width of the Horseshoe Falls, thus, the only Waterfalls that are similar in these two parameters are the Iguazú, in the boarder of Argentina and Brazil.</p>

          <h2>Northern Lights</h2>
		  <p>The aurora borealis, also called the Northern Lights, is a multi-colored brilliant light show in the Earth's atmosphere that is caused by the collision of gas particles in the Earth's atmosphere with charged electrons from the sun's atmosphere. The aurora borealis is most often viewed at high latitudes close to the magnetic north pole but during times of maximum activity they can be viewed very far south of the Arctic Circle. Maximum auroral activity is rare however and the aurora borealis is normally only seen in or near the Arctic Circle in places like Alaska, Canada and Norway.</p>
