          <h2>Chichen Itza Mayan</h2>
		  <p>Chichen Itza, or Chichén Itzá, offers a rare glimpse into Mayan and Toltec civilization in Mexico. Located about 90 miles from the coast in the northern Yucatan peninsula, the archaeological site has temples, palaces, and other important buildings. There are actually two parts to Chichen: the old city that thrived between 300 and 900 AD, and the new city that became the center of Mayan civilization between 750 and 1200 AD. Chichen Itza is a UNESCO World Heritage site and voted to be a new wonder of the world.</p>
